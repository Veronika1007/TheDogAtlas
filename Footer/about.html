        <h1>Built by Dog Parents, for Dog Parents</h1>
        <p>
          The story behind TheDogAtlas and our mission to change how we travel
          with our best friends.
        </p>
      </section>

      <article class="about-content">
        <h2>Why We Started</h2>
        <p>
          The idea for TheDogAtlas was born out of a simple struggle we faced as
          dog parents ourselves. Whenever we traveled, we spent hours trying to
          find dog-friendly activities and places to go. After countless
          searches, we realized there wasn't a single, fully encompassing
          website or app that had everything we needed in one place.
        </p>

        <div class="story-quote">
          "Initially, this started as a fun activity for our own travel
          itineraries. But the more we thought about it, the more we wanted to
          bring this to all dog parents out there."
        </div>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          We know the challenges that dog owners face. Our goal is to make life
          easier and your travels more pleasurable, whether you have one tiny
          dog, a large breed, or a whole pack. We believe that bringing your dog
          along should be a joy, not a logistical headache.
        </p>

        <h2>For the Community</h2>
        <p>
          This is a working project that is very dear to our hearts. We are
          building more than just a search tool; we are establishing a community
          where dog parents can support one another. We want to help you create
          wonderful memories with your lovely dogs, wherever your journey takes
          you.
